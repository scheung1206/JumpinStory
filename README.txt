CS134 Final Project

Jumping’ Story

Goal of the game is to complete this jump quest and escape using the Taxi.

Movement can be used as WASD or Arrow Keys. 
Jump is used as Space.

The inspiration behind this project is the 2D elements reminded me of MapleStory.
MapleStory was a popular game, so I believe everyone in the class will have fun playing something similar. Jump quest something people either liked or hated in MapleStory. I thought it would be fun to make a Jump Quest using MapleStory sprites to make it nostalgic for the player.
